                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Skye Yang and this is my portfolio website.
                    This is my portfolio website, where you can learn more about me and explore my work and interests.
                    You can navigate my website by clicking the letters of my name at the header.
                    Each letter will take you to the content you'll find on its respective page.
                </p>
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Skye Yang, this website was first created when I was seventeen years old.
                    I am Hmong, and I value my skills and want to express myself while striving to be respectful and
                    friendly with everyone I meet, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
                    I have a family of four including my mom, dad, and older sister. Me along with my family are very
                    hard working and passionate individuals.
                    My passions and education are serNiously important and I value others as well. I really like working
                    with others.
                    In most cases people want to be alone but when people have the decency to work with others, I fit
                    with them pretty well.

            <section id="hob" class="indie">
                <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about technology and the internet.
                    I usually go on the internet and normally explore social media, listening to music, researching,
                    reading and watching videos of online information.
                    I'm also a writer, I specialize in narrative literature but am also skilled in informative and
                    argumentative writing.
                    My interest in movies and shows has led me to develop skills in photo and video editing. I use photo
                    editing websites like Pixlr, Photopea, Figma, Canva, Adobe Express.
                    Photo softwares I use are Adobe Photoshop and Paint.net.
                    Before I even had a computer, I used video softwares like Imovie and PowerDirector, now I use
                    Openshot Video Editor.
                    I also take pride in preserving old or forgotten items as an archivist.
                    I feel very good when I have things that are considered old or forgotten.
                </p>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been attending school since I was four years old and have experienced education at institutions
                    such as Cedarwood Elementary, Clark Intermediate, Clovis High School, Clovis Community College, and
                    the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART).
                    With many years and experiences at school, I have come to grow and adapt to it.
                    My favorite subjects are English and History, as they foster my creativity and broaden my
                    perspective and give me a larger outlook on life.
                    I'm also skilled at Math and Science, they are not as significant as English and History but they
                    have major importance to me.
                    I take pride in achieving my academic goals, such as aiming for high grades and completing homework
                    and in class assignments.

                <h2>My Awards and Achievements</h2>
                <p>
                    I tend not to dwell on awards or achievements, I usually move on to the next challenge after I'm
                    completing something.
                    As a result, I don't have a lengthy list of awards to share.

                <h2>My Secondary Plan</h2>
                <h3>Senior Year</h3>
                <p>
                    This section would become irrelevant in a few months so here's something short.
                    As I approach the final stretch of my high school journey, I'll try to embrace the end that is my
                    senior year. I am also doing some college preparations so I'm taking classes that can prepare me for
                    the obstacles I'll run into.
                    I'm also seizing the opportunity to delve deeper into technology through rigorous computer classes.
                    I'll try to have more experience and improve on the challenges that lie ahead.
                    Overall, I'll have some enjoyment in the last year of my high school career.
                </p>
                <h3>College</h3>
                <p>
                    I've taken some college classes during high school giving me some progress on college.
                    I'm up to be enrolled in either Clovis Community or Fresno, I'm going for a computer science degree
                    as it offers a gateway to a myriad of career opportunities.
                    It's also something I am good at, it aligns with both my aptitude and aspirations.
                    I don't know where to transfer, if I really want a bachelor's degree but I'll figure it out.
                    I am kinda interested in the college experience but I have an uneasy feeling that I have to use more
                    of my time to tackle it.
                    My path is uncertain but I remain eager to explore the rich tapestry of collegiate experiences that
                    await.
                </p>
                <h3>My Future Career</h3>
                <p>
                    At the core of my aspirations lies a dual passion for writing and computer programming.
                    Being a writer is what I truly am as I want to do new things every once in a while and express
                    myself.
                    I also want to provide commentary about my views on the world, its problems and struggles, and
                    commentaries are very thought-provoking for me.
                    Computer programming is still a part of me but I feel like I can't be entirely happy with it.
                    I'm really good at it but I don't like the struggles and high stakes it has.
                    The only thing programming provides is money which I can take.
                    This could entirely change but I'm going for this because my happiness is first and foremost.
                    I envision my career path that blends my talents in both realms, prioritizing my happiness but still
                    makes me a professional.

                    Special thanks to my parents who read and checked this website.
                    Also special thanks to Mr. Jared Fast, my CART Web App Design teacher, for teaching me how to code
                    and help with the JavaScript of the website,
                    without him this website wouldn't exist.
